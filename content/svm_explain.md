SVM is a non-linear classifer model.

Based on which kernel you choose, it can draw a decision boundary by projecting the data points into a higher dimension where it possibly becomes linear separable.

The hyperparameters are C, gamma, and kernel.

C is the penalty parameter of the error term.

Gamma is the kernel coefficient for radial basis function (RBF) kernel.

Kernel is the kernel type to be used in the algorithm.

The kernel type includes linear, poly, rbf, sigmoid, and precomputed.

The kernel type can be chosen based on the problem statement.
